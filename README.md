## üìê Click-Through Rate (CTR)

CTR measures how effective your campaign is in generating clicks.

**Formula:**

\[
\text{CTR (\%)} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Clicks}}{\text{Total Impressions}} \right) \times 100
\]

Where:
- `Total Clicks` = Number of records where `is_click == 1`
- `Total Impressions` = Total records in `train.csv`

## üìä Output Visualizations (Auto-Saved)

After running the script, the following charts are saved as `.png`:

| File Name                    | Description                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `clicks_by_app_code.png`    | Bar chart of clicks grouped by app     |
| `device_type_distribution.png` | Pie chart showing device usage     |
